# [WIP] Red Dragon Joker

This ruleset assumes that you have read [base.md](base.md). These rules are translated from [here](https://www.17dp.com/down/gamelist/id/223).

The wall for Red Dragon Joker consists of the 1-9 character tiles, 1-9 circle tiles, 1-9 bamboo tiles, four red dragon tiles, and optionally, the four flower tiles and the four season tiles. (Some playgroups use the green and white dragons as flower tiles instead.)

To win, you must achieve four sets and a pair.

You can Pung, Kong, Chankan, and Zimo, but you cannot Chi or Hu. Temporary furiten exists on Pung. Multiple chankans are resolved by headbump.

Red Dragon tiles are treated as unlimited jokers instead of red dragons. They cannot be used for Pung or Kong.

<<TODO: translate "如果玩家在打牌过程中，打出了“百搭”牌，该百搭牌则失去百搭的下沟哦，只作为它本身的牌面的普通牌。如果这位玩家胡牌了，这张牌也不能作为百搭牌参与底分计算。". Right now it appears to be "If a player discards a joker, it ceases to be a joker, and the player cannot count this joker if they win.", but that seems un-mention-worthy?>>
