# Guide To Jokers

This document is a reference for how all the various tiles in [`tiles.md`](documentation/tiles.md) are commonly used.

## Standard tiles

These tiles are the standard tiles used in Riichi and most variants. The suits, `m`an, `p`in, and `s`ou, are notated with their first letter. `z` stands for "jihai", and indicates winds and dragons.

Note that `5z` is a White Dragon (specific to Riichi), but is also used as a blank. `0m`, `0p`, and `0s` are red fives (which, in Riichi, give extra score).

## Variant tiles and spacers

`0z` is the more-common design of the White Dragon, featured in most Chinese sets. `8z` is the variant most-often used in Malaysian and Singaporean sets.

`9z` is a Kansai-style shiro-pocchi. This is used in some parlour variants of Riichi. It is normally used as a White Dragon, but if a player declares Riichi and then draws the shiro-pocchi on a later turn, they instantly win and the shiro-pocchi is used as a joker.

`00s` is the more-common design of the `1s`.

`10m`, `10p`, and `10s` are Ten tiles. Apparently these are sold by some vendors, but we don't know of any mahjong variant that seriously uses them. We've included them here anyway.

`1x` is a tile back. `2x` through to `8x` are transparent spaces used for formatting.

## Flowers

`1f` through to `4f` are flowers (specifically, the Four Gentlemen quartet), while `1g` through to `4g` are the Seasons quartet.

`1a` through to `4a` are animal tiles common to Singaporean mahjong (in order, Cat, Rat, Chicken, and Centipede).

`1k` through to `4k` are "king" tiles, while `1q` through to `4q` are "queen" tiles. These are treated as flowers in Vietnamese mahjong.

`1y` is a face tile. This is treated as a flower in Malaysian mahjong.

## Jokers

`1j` is an American-style joker. Under NMJL rules, it can substitute for any tile in any Pung, Kong, Quint, or Sextet, but never in a single, pair, or set of singles (such as NEWS, 2025, or 123).

`0j` is a Vietnamese-style joker. It has no restrictions. (TODO: double-check this.) `20j` is another Vietnamese variant of this. `10j` and `2y` are Chinese and Malaysian variants of this.

`2j` is a Vietnamese-style number joker. It substitute for any number tile of any manzu, souzu, or pinzu. `12j` is another variant of this.

`9j`, `4j`, `5j`, `6j`, `7j`, and `8j` are Vietnamese-style jokers. Respectively, they can substitute for any flower, dragon, wind, pinzu, souzu, or manzu tile.

`12j` works like `2j`.

`3j` is a Chinese-style honour joker. It can substitute for any honour tile.

`14j`, `15j`, `17j`, and `18j` are variants of `4j`, `5j`, `7j`, and `8j` respectively.

`19j`, `37j`, `46j`, `147j`, `258j`, and `369j` are number-restricted jokers that can substitute for any of the numbers on their face. `91j`, `64j`, `73j`, and `852j` are variants of some of these.

`789j`, `456j`, and `123j` are also number-restricted jokers. These can substitute for large, medium, and small numbers respectively (or just see their codes to see which tiles they can substitute for).

`11j` and `22j` can substitute for any odd and any even number respectively.

`30j` can substitute for any five or any honour.

`31j` can substitute for the middle tile of any sequence, or any honour.

`32j` and `33j` respectively can substitute for any tile that isn't/is already in one's hand.

`34j` can substitute for any tile for which all four naturals are publicly visible, or for which no naturals are publicly visible.

## Star tiles

These are tiles of a fourth "star" suit, as seen in four-suit mahjong variants. `10t` is a ten. Note that the above number jokers, `2j` and `12j`, do not apply to these (unless you decide that they should).

## Galaxy tiles

These are used in [Galaxy Mahjong](galaxy.md). Numbered blue tiles may be used as number-restricted jokers of that number. Blue wind and blue dragon tiles are used as wind and dragon jokers respectively. Galaxy Mahjong awards extra points for using jokers as their naturals.

## Aka/Ao/Kin/Transparent

Many of the above natural tiles, now as red, dark-blue, and gold variants (for extra parlour riichi rules). Transparent tiles, starting with `4`, are also included, to allow for setting tiles as any colour you like.
